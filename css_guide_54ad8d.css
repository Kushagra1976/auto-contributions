/*
  Learning Objective:
  This tutorial will teach you how to create a visually engaging button
  with subtle hover animations using CSS transitions and transforms.
  We will focus on making the button respond smoothly to user interaction,
  enhancing the user experience.

/*
  --- Resetting Default Button Styles (Good Practice) ---
  Buttons often have default browser styles that can be inconsistent.
  We'll reset some of these to have full control over our button's appearance.
  'border: none;' removes the default border.
  'outline: none;' removes the focus outline that appears on click (though consider accessibility alternatives for focus indicators).
  'cursor: pointer;' changes the mouse cursor to a hand when hovering over the button, indicating it's clickable.
  'background-color: transparent;' sets the initial background to be see-through, allowing our defined background to show.
*/
.animated-button {
  border: none;
  outline: none;
  cursor: pointer;
  background-color: transparent;
  font-size: 1.2rem; /* Makes the text size larger and more readable */
  padding: 15px 30px; /* Adds space inside the button around the text */
  margin: 10px; /* Adds space outside the button */
  border-radius: 8px; /* Rounds the corners of the button */
  color: #ffffff; /* Sets the text color to white */
  background-color: #007bff; /* Sets the initial background color to a vibrant blue */
  position: relative; /* Essential for positioning pseudo-elements later if needed, and good practice for interactive elements */
  overflow: hidden; /* Hides any content that goes beyond the button's borders, important for animations */
  transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out; /* --- The Core of Our Animation! --- */
  /*
    'transition' is a powerful CSS property that allows us to smoothly change
    property values over a specified duration.
    'all': This tells the browser to animate ALL animatable CSS properties.
           In this case, it will animate properties like 'background-color',
           'transform', 'box-shadow', etc., when they change.
    '0.3s': This is the duration of the transition, meaning the animation
            will take 0.3 seconds to complete.
    'ease-in-out': This is the timing function, which controls the speed curve
                   of the animation. 'ease-in-out' makes the animation start
                   slowly, speed up in the middle, and slow down again at the end,
                   creating a natural and pleasing effect.

/*
  --- Hover State Styling ---
  This is where we define what happens when the user hovers their mouse over the button.
  We're using the ':hover' pseudo-class for this.
*/
.animated-button:hover {
  background-color: #0056b3; /* Darkens the background color on hover */
  color: #ffffff; /* Keeps the text color white */
  box-shadow: 0 8px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Adds a subtle shadow for depth on hover */
  transform: translateY(-2px); /* --- A Subtle Lift Animation! --- */
  /*
    'transform' allows us to modify the appearance and position of an element
    without affecting the layout of other elements.
    'translateY(-2px)': This moves the button 2 pixels upwards along the Y-axis.
                       This creates a "lifting" effect, making it feel more interactive.
                       Negative values move upwards, positive values move downwards.
  */
}

/*
  --- Active State Styling (Click Effect) ---
  This is what happens when the user clicks and holds the button.
  We use the ':active' pseudo-class for this.
*/
.animated-button:active {
  background-color: #004085; /* Even darker background when actively clicked */
  transform: translateY(0); /* --- Resetting the Lift --- */
  /*
    When the button is active (clicked), we reset the 'translateY' to '0'.
    This makes the button appear to "press down" slightly as it returns
    to its original position from the hover state. This provides good feedback.
  */
  box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); /* Reduces the shadow to simulate being pressed */
}

/*
  --- Example Usage ---
  To use this button, you would create an HTML element like this:

  <button class="animated-button">Click Me!</button>

  And then include this CSS in your stylesheet.
*/

/*
  --- Additional Considerations for Beginners ---
  - You can animate almost any CSS property with 'transition'. Experiment!
  - Combine different transform functions (e.g., scale, rotate) for more complex effects.
  - For accessibility, ensure that your hover and active states are distinct enough
    and that there's a clear focus indicator for keyboard users (e.g., using :focus).
    You could add styles for `.animated-button:focus` to provide this.
  - The 'ease-in-out' timing function can be replaced with others like 'linear',
    'ease-in', 'ease-out', or custom cubic-bezier curves for different animation feels.
